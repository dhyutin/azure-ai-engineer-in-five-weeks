To estimate the total number of windows, one would need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Population and Building Count**: New York City has over 8 million residents and more than 1 million buildings, including residential, commercial, and industrial properties.\n\n2. **Average Windows per Building**: Different types of buildings have varying numbers of windows. For example, commercial buildings might have more windows compared to residential homes. An estimation might involve averages for different building types.\n\n3. **Calculation**: An estimation can be made by multiplying the estimated average number of windows per type of building (residential, commercial, etc.) by the count of those buildings in the city.\n\n4. **Total Estimate**: Once averages are established and applied to the total building count, one could derive a rough estimate.\n\nHowever, this process involves many assumptions and estimates, so any figure would be speculative. If you need a specific figure or more detailed analysis, further research or a statistical study would be required.","2":"Evaluations typically occur annually and can depend on several factors. Here\u2019s a general outline of how you might be evaluated each year:\n\n1. **Performance Goals**: You will likely be assessed against specific performance objectives set at the start of the evaluation period. These goals should be aligned with organizational priorities.\n\n2. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Your progress may be measured using quantitative and qualitative KPIs relevant to your role. These metrics can include sales targets, project completions, client satisfaction scores, etc.\n\n3. **Feedback from Peers and Supervisors**: 360-degree feedback may be collected, which involves input from colleagues, supervisors, and possibly clients. This comprehensive feedback can provide insights into your teamwork, collaboration, and communication skills.\n\n4. **Self-Assessment**: You may be asked to complete a self-evaluation, reflecting on your accomplishments, areas for improvement, and professional development over the past year.\n\n5. **Professional Development**: Evaluation can consider your growth in skills and competencies through training or development programs, and how you've applied new skills in your role.\n\n6. **Attendance and Punctuality**: Consistency in attendance and punctuality may also be part of your evaluation criteria.\n\n7. **Overall Contribution to Team\/Company**: Your overall contributions to your team and the organization, including initiatives taken or leadership roles played, will likely be assessed.\n\nOnce evaluations are completed, you may have a formal review meeting with your supervisor to discuss the results and any potential next steps, such as promotions or developmental opportunities."},"context":{"0":[[]],"1":[[]],"2":[[]]}}
