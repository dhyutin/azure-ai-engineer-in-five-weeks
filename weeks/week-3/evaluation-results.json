This process may include several components, such as self-assessments, manager assessments, and feedback from peers or colleagues. The evaluation criteria may focus on various factors, including your achievement of goals, quality of work, teamwork, and contribution to the organization. The specific method and criteria for evaluation can vary by organization, so it is advisable to refer to your employee handbook or speak with your HR representative for the details relevant to your company."
